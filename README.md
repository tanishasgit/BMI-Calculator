# BMI Calculator

A simple and intuitive BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator built with React. This application helps users calculate their BMI based on their weight and height. The result is dynamically displayed along with a categorized health status, providing clear visual feedback through color-coded categories.

- **Real-Time BMI Calculation:** The BMI value is calculated instantly as users move the sliders, ensuring up-to-date information.
- **Dynamic Feedback:** The application categorizes the BMI result into one of several health categories (Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, Obese), with each category highlighted using distinct colors for quick visual assessment.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts to various screen sizes, making the calculator accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Usage

3. The calculator will display your BMI value and categorize it into one of the following categories:
   - Underweight
